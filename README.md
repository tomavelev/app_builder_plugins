IntelliJ Plugin that could load a list of actions from a Back-End and integrate them into the IDE.

I'm creating in my free time a Swiss Knife https://programtom.com/dev/product/app-builder-code-generation-spring-micro-service-vaadin-app/ .
It also includes the Backend for this plugin. You could grab this source code, replace the [host constant] to point to your Back-End and run it internally - without anything going out of your organization.

Build/Package - with "gradle :assemble".

TODO - Write Documentaiton:
- models
- endpoints
- integration points/requirements
- user interface
- - New File Generators
  - Existing File Improvers (Code Assist)
